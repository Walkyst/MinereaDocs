# Privacy Policy

In order to be able to offer our services, we process and store personal data such as messages, reactions, channel access, role assignments etc. from the systems of Discord Inc. (“Discord”), 444 De Haro St, Suite 200, San Francisco, CA 94107. You can find their privacy policy at [https://discord.com/privacy](https://discord.com/privacy). We also use the data in compliance with the API terms of use, available at [https://discord.com/terms](https://discord.com/terms). The retrieved data is public data that can also be viewed by anyone who has a discord account and has joined the corresponding server. We retrieve data from you if your account is represented on a Discord server that is connected to our systems. We use and save parts of the data retrieved in order to automatically respond to your messages or, for example, to carry out other actions based on certain words in messages or given reactions. These include warnings, automatically sent messages in other channels or private chats, adding or removing roles and all other actions on a Discord server that are conceivable due to the capabilities of the API. Exactly which function is triggered depends entirely on the particular function of our system. These functions can each be highly individualized by Discord server administrators and therefore not detailed here.

The stored and/or processed data are also made available to other members of the server on request, depending on the individual configuration.

The documentation of the Discord API can be found at https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro
